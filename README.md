## Hi there 👋

I am Mallikarjun, a passionate Frontend Developer who enjoys building responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.

I work mainly with ReactJs, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and also have experience with Python, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, MySQL, SQLite3, MongoDB, and REST APIs.

Always curious and excited to learn new things, improve my skills, and bring ideas to life through code.

When I’m not coding, you will probably find me watching or playing cricket — it is one of my favorite ways to unwind! 🏏
